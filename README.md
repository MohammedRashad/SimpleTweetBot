# StudyTweetBot
A Tweet Bot which is the base for @_StudyBot_ Twitter Account

===

It was build as a fun bot that tells people to study and also as a demonstration on how a twitter bot can be implemented.

First Versions were messily coded but functional, I recoded the whole bot, and now it's more efficient and less-likely to fail.

**Idea :**

- Search for users based on a random query from a list of related items
- Choose a random user with a tweet containing the query
- replies to him, advicing him to study
- after a predefined sleep time it tweets a random tweet then sleeps again
- repeat

**Features :**

- Console-Based
- Cross Platform
- Choose users randomly
- More than 10 replies to be choosen from randomly
- Open-Source Project
- Based on twitter4j library

**Changelog :**
- V1.x : A functional code.
- V2.0 :
    - Re-written the whole code
    - More modular code to allow future improvements
    - Added new replies 
    - Increased the range of users to choose from
